            <div class="about-content">
                <p>Hey! I'm Chengyu Gong, an upcoming senior undergraduate student at the University of Washington, majoring in Computational Finance and Risk Management (CFRM) and Mathematics with a dual degree!</p>
                <p>I'm passionate about exploring new technologies and applying them to real-world problems, which is why I chose to study CFRM. I enjoy using sophisticated mathematical models to solve practical market issues. Currently, my research combines databases, multimodal analysis, and large language models (LLMs). I believe these cutting-edge technologies can drive the world towards better development.</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy photography, music, and playing board games. Recently, I've also been learning magic tricks, which has been quite challenging for me, but I really enjoy the process!</p>

                    <p>Advisor: Prof. Léonard Boussioux</p>
                    <p>Performed feature extraction using SAE. Controlled output safety through feature adjustment. For more on the SAE algorithm click <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE</a></p>
                    <p>Conducted sentiment analysis on market public opinion using LLMs, processing inputs to capture semantic and emotional cues, and analyzed the potential relationship between market sentiment and the venture capital market.</p>
                    <p>In my current research, I explore how large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 evaluate and generate ideas, focusing on their application in venture capital decision-making. This involves training models on extensive datasets to capture the subtle patterns of successful investment strategies.</p>
                    <p>My project investigates the "thought process" of AI in evaluating the quality of ideas, such as assessing the potential of startup pitches or the effectiveness of business strategies. I employ techniques like prompt engineering and fine-tuning to adapt models to specific contexts, enhancing their decision-making capabilities.</p>

                    <h3>Vector Databases - HPDIC lab</h3>
                    <p>Advisor: Prof. Dongfang Zhao</p>
                    <p>In my recent research project, I tackled a critical challenge in scientific data management by developing the Order-Preserving Dimension Reduction (OPDR) method to efficiently process k-nearest neighbors queries in multimodal datasets. This method significantly reduces the dimensionality of embedding vectors while maintaining accurate relational data in a reduced-dimensional space. I successfully formulated a quantitative function that elucidates the correlation between reduced dimensions and other key variables, culminating in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preprint</a>. Our experiments verified that OPDR effectively manages high-dimensional data, enhancing performance in time-sensitive scientific applications.</p>
                    <p>I am currently exploring the application of our developed OPDR algorithm in the financial sector. Additionally, our lab's upcoming research will focus on investigating the applications of Entropic Multimodality in vector databases. This innovative research initiative aims to leverage the principles of Entropic Multimodality to enhance the processing efficiency and accuracy of vector databases during complex query execution and data interactions.</p>
