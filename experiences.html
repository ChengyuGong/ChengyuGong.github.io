                    <p>Served as a Research Assistant and Educational Technology Consultant in a project that delved into the Lean programming language, a proof system designed for verifying mathematical proofs and automating technical computations in research</p>
                    <p>Applied Lean programming to formalize 'Math 300' textbook exercises by Conroy, enriching academic materials. Created a guide for Lean learners and Math 300 students, focusing on Lean's application in mathematical problem solving and proof verificationConducted in depth analysis on the logic presented by the Lean language, ensuring its consistency and rectifying potential inconsistencies</p>

                    <p class="date">Jan 2024 - Present · 9 mos</p>
                    <p>In my recent research project, I tackled a critical challenge in scientific data management by developing the Order-Preserving Dimension Reduction (OPDR) method to efficiently process k-nearest neighbors queries in multimodal datasets. This method significantly reduces the dimensionality of embedding vectors while maintaining accurate relational data in a reduced-dimensional space. I successfully formulated a quantitative function that elucidates the correlation between reduced dimensions and other key variables, culminating in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preprint</a>. Our experiments verified that OPDR effectively manages high-dimensional data, enhancing performance in time-sensitive scientific applications.</p>
                    <p>Our forthcoming research will concentrate on investigating the applications of Entropic Multimodality in Vector Databases. This innovative research initiative is designed to leverage the principles of Entropic Multimodality to optimize the processing efficiency and precision of vector databases during complex query execution and data interactions.</p>

                    <p>In my current research, I explore how large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 evaluate and generate ideas, focusing on their application in venture capital decision-making. This involves training models on extensive datasets to capture the subtle patterns of successful investment strategies.</p>
                    <p>My project investigates the "thought process" of AI in evaluating the quality of ideas, such as assessing the potential of startup pitches or the effectiveness of business strategies. I employ techniques like prompt engineering and fine-tuning to adapt models to specific contexts, enhancing their decision-making capabilities.</p>
